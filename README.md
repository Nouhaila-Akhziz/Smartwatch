This repository contains the source code and documentation for the smartwatch, which offers a range of exciting features. The smartwatch is equipped with the following functionalities:
### Ambient Light and Heart Rate Sensors 
The smartwatch includes ambient light and heart rate sensors that allow users to monitor their environment and track their heart rate accurately. The ambient light sensor adjusts the screen brightness based on the surrounding lighting conditions, ensuring optimal visibility at all times. The heart rate sensor enables users to measure their heart rate and track it during workouts or daily activities.
### Local Temperature
With the built-in local temperature sensor, the smartwatch provides real-time temperature information for your current location. It enables users to stay informed about the temperature and plan their activities accordingly. The temperature data is displayed on the watch face or can be accessed through a dedicated app.
### Local Time
The smartwatch displays the local time, allowing users to keep track of time conveniently. It automatically synchronizes with the local time zone and provides accurate timekeeping functionality. The time is prominently displayed on the watch face and is easily accessible at a glance.
### Magnetometer and Gyroscope 
The smartwatch is equipped with a magnetometer and gyroscope, enabling advanced motion sensing capabilities. The magnetometer detects the strength and direction of magnetic fields, allowing users to navigate or interact with magnetic objects. The gyroscope detects rotation and orientation, enabling the smartwatch to provide accurate motion tracking and orientation data.
### Making Watch Faces
The smartwatch provides the flexibility to create and customize watch faces. Users can design their own watch faces or choose from a variety of pre-designed options. With the provided tools and resources, users can personalize their smartwatch's appearance, including customizing the layout, colors, and complications displayed on the watch face.
